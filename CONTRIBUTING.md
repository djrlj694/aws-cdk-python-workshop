# Contributing Guidelines

Version-controllable contributions toward improving [this project][README] (its source
code, documentation, etc.) are welcome via GitHub's [pull request] process. By
submitting a merge request, you acknowledge and agree to licensing your
contribution to [djrlj694.dev][owner].

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish

## Merge Request Process

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the
   layer when doing a build.
2. Update the [README] with details of changes to the interface. This includes
   new environment variables, exposed ports, useful file locations
   and container parameters.
3. Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the [README] to the
   new version that this pull request would represent. The versioning scheme we
   use is [SemVer].
4. You may merge in the merge request once you have the sign-off of two other
   developers. If you do not have permission to do that, you may request the
   second reviewer to merge it for you.
